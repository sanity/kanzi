ick. icky day... i can't wait to get to Austin for sxsw. i've been fighting with my mom a lot. <br><br>
for a long time, she was getting onto me about being depressed over will still, and she was trying to bribe me into taking antidepressants by saying i couldn't go on the family trip to europe this summer unless i did. well, now the trip's been cancelled so she doesn't have anything to bribe me with. now she's just making me. not like she's forcing it down my throat, but she -is- constantly nagging me. and i'm just so apathetic these days that i figured why not give it another try.<br><br>
it's paxil. she made me take paxil for awhile in junior high and i remember i hated the way it made me feel. now i'm on it for my first day, and since i have a lot more drugs to compare it to i can tell you exactly -why- i hate the way it makes me feel. i feel like i'm coming down off acid. i've felt that way all day. and anyone who's done acid knows that it totally sucks to feel that way. plus i'm all nauseous. ick!<br><br>
i definitely don't want to keep taking this shit.</ul>

If she insists on making you take drugs then tell her you need to take different ones.  Just because it works for her and your dad, doesn't mean that it's right for you.  That's silly logic.  If it makes you feel bad, tell your doctor and have him switch you.  Tell him it makes you feel more depressed.  That's why I can't take Paxil.  It made me scratch big holes in my legs and seriously contemplate killing myself.  Effexor was much nicer.  There's also welbutrin that's out now and it's supposed to be good.</td></tr></table>

heh.<br><br>well. i still feel jittery and nauseous today, but slightly less so. so perhaps it'll go away in time. and it could be because i'm now done PMSing, or it could be the drugs, but today i feel somewhat better. and i'm not on the verge of tears constantly. i've noticed these ads on teevee for some drug which they say treats "PMDD" which is supposed to be like PMS on crack which seems to be what i've been getting since New York. so maybe i need that. it seems like getting birth control from planned parenthood would be cheaper...<br><br>who knows. all i know is i'm looking forward to getting away from my mother (and the rest of my crazy family) for awhile. I love them, but they're much better when we have a buffer of a few hundred miles. that's just the way we work.</td></tr></table>
