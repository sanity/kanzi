  <title>Kanzi 1.0 User Manual
  </title>
  <chapter><title>Introduction</title>
    <para>This is the User Manual for Kanzi, Cematics' intelligent web
      development tool. Kanzi is designed to bring the flexibility of tools
      that computer programmers have been using for years, to the world
      of web development. Kanzi's core goal is to integrate seamlessly
      with the web development tools with which you are already familiar,
      meaning that you can get started with it immediately.
   </para>
    <para>Kanzi is useful when you need to make changes to a large number
      of web pages. You demonstrate the changes you need made on one of
      the pages using your favourite HTML editing tool, and Kanzi will
      intelligently figure out what has changed, and how those changes
      are to be applied to the other pages you have selected.

    <sect1>
      <title>Requirements</title>
      <para>
        Kanzi requires Java version 1.2 or greater. This may be downloaded
        from <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/getjava/" name="">http://java.sun.com/getjava</ulink>, and will 
        require just a couple of minutes to install for most
        users. Kanzi will work on any version of Windows that supports Java,
        including Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows NT, Windows XP, and Windows
        ME.

      <title>Installation</title>
      <para>
        Double click on the Kanzi installer, which you can download from
        <ulink url="http://cematics.com/site.php/kanzi/">
          http://cematics.com/site.php/kanzi/</ulink>
        , and follow the steps in the installation Wizard which appears.
        In most cases, you will not need to change any of the default settings.

      <title>Registration</title>
      <para>Initially when you install Kanzi it will be in evaluation mode,
        this will be indicated by the words "Evaluation Version" at the bottom
        of the Kanzi window. This is designed to allow you to determine whether
        Kanzi is useful to you before purchasing it, but it cannot be used
        with a real website as it randomly replaces text with a warning message
        in any web pages that it modifies.
      </para><para>To use Kanzi properly, you must obtain a license key. This may
        be purchased from <ulink url="http://cematics.com/site.php/kanzi">http://cematics.com/site.php/kanzi</ulink>.
      </para>
      <para>After purchasing the license key, it will be emailed to the address
        you provided. To register, follow these simple steps:

    <title>Using Kanzi</title>
    <para>There are three basic steps to using Kanzi:
    </para>
    <para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Select the "example" file, and make the changes you want to it</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Select the files to which you want those changes to be applied</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Review the changes Kanzi made, then either commit or undo them</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <sect1>
      <title>Training Kanzi</title>
      <para>When you first start Kanzi, you will be invited to select the
        "example" file. This should be one of the HTML pages that you want
        to modify. You should then use your favourite HTML editor to make
        the modifications to that page that you want to apply to the other
        pages, and save it.
      </para>
      <para>Once you have saved the file, you will be able to click on "Next"
        and move on to the next step.
      </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
      <title>Selecting target pages</title>
      <para>Next you must select the pages to which you would like Kanzi
        to apply these changes. You can select each file individually using
        the "Add File(s)" button, or add all HTML files in a directory using
        the "Add a Directory" button.
      </para>
      <para>You may now decide which of these files you would like those
        changes applied to, by clicking on them you may select and deselect
        them. Only the selected files will be modified.
      </para>
      <para>A much more convenient way to select the files you would like
        to modify is to use the Similarity Filter. You can activate it by
        clicking on the check box. You may now move the slider up and down,
        and files will be selected and deselected based on their similarity
        to the example file which you modified in the previous step.
      </para>
      <para>Click "Next" when the files you wish to modify are highlighted.
      </para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1>
      <title>Reviewing changes</title>
      <para>The changes will now be applied to the pages. This should occur
        quite quickly, but the time required may vary depending on the extent
        of the changes to the example page, and the number of target pages.
      </para>
      <para>You may now review the changes Kanzi has made to these pages.
        You can launch a web-browser pointing at the (modified) example page
        by clicking on "Review Your Documents". You should check the target
        files to ensure that Kanzi has applied the changes correctly.
      </para>
      <para>If it has, you can apply the changes permenantly by clicking
        on "Finish". You can undo the changes by clicking on "Undo".
      </para>

      Troubleshooting
    </title>
    <sect1>
      <title>Kanzi applied my changes incorrectly</title>
      <para>Kanzi is smart, but it does have limitations and may occasionally
        apply your changes incorrectly. If this happens, try splitting up
        the changes, first applying one set, then applying the other. The
        fewer changes you make to the example document - the easier it is
        for Kanzi.
      </para>
      <para>If this doesn't work, you should email the target document (before
        and after your edit), and one of the documents to which the change
        was misapplied (before any modification) to support@cematics.com
        for us to take a look. We will do our best to determine why Kanzi
        failed and will send you the next revision of Kanzi when it is ready.
      </para>

      <title>Kanzi crashed unexpectedly</title>
      <para>Send an email to support@cematics.com explaining the circumstances
        under which Kanzi crashed.
